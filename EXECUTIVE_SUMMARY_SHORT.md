# NokeApp - Executive Summary (Short Version)

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Create React Native SDK (NPM packages) for third-party integration with Noke Smart Locks.

**Deliverables**:
1. `@noke/ble-manager` - Native BLE library (headless, works with any UI)
2. `@noke/ui-components` - Pre-built UI components (optional for clients)

**Current Phase**: Development and validation in NokeApp (demo project).

**Strategy**: Hybrid architecture support (Old + New) so clients with any React Native version can use it.

## Current Status ‚úÖ

### What's Working Now

**Production-Ready BLE (Home Tab)**:
- Full scanning, connection, device management
- Live updates with search and filtering
- Uses `react-native-ble-manager` library
- Status: ‚úÖ Fully functional

**Native Module Infrastructure (Validated)**:
- TestModule: Simple native methods working
- NativeScanner: Native BLE scanning working
- Turbo Modules: Proven to work in project
- Status: ‚úÖ Ready for complex code

### App Structure

```
3 Tabs:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Home (BLE Library)      ‚Üí Production ready
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Native (Native Module)  ‚Üí BLE scan demo
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Settings (Tests)        ‚Üí Module validation
```

## Why We Need Custom Native Modules

### Library Limitations

**react-native-ble-manager works for**:
- Basic scan/connect
- Standard BLE operations
- Generic devices

**Noke Smart Locks require**:
- ‚úã Custom GATT profiles (proprietary protocols)
- ‚úã Complex unlock sequences (multi-step operations)
- ‚úã IoT-specific authentication
- ‚úã Firmware updates over BLE
- ‚úã Time-sensitive commands
- ‚úã Advanced security protocols

**Conclusion**: Library is insufficient for Noke's advanced IoT features.

## Migration Plan

### Phase 0: BLE Library ‚úÖ DONE
- Integrated react-native-ble-manager
- Built production-ready UI
- Working scan/connect functionality

### Phase 1: Validation ‚úÖ DONE
- Created TestModule (simple native)
- Created NativeScanner (BLE scan native)
- Validated Turbo Modules work

### Phase 2: Import Existing Code (NEXT - 2 weeks)
- Get existing native BLE code
- Import scanning logic
- Add connection management
- Test against library baseline

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (3-4 weeks)
- Noke proprietary protocols
- Unlock sequences
- Firmware updates
- Full IoT feature set

### Phase 4: Production (1 week)
- Remove library dependency
- Production testing
- Deploy

**Total Timeline**: ~6-8 weeks

## Technical Architecture

### Turbo Native Modules

**What**: React Native's modern native module system

**Benefits**:
- Direct native-to-JS calls (faster than bridge)
- Type-safe via Codegen
- Supports Old + New Architecture
- Better performance for BLE

**Our Modules**:
1. TestModule ‚Üí Validation
2. NativeScanner ‚Üí BLE scan only
3. NokeBleManager ‚Üí Full BLE (ready for code)

### BLE Service Facade

**What**: Abstraction layer to switch implementations

**How**:
```typescript
const BLE_IMPLEMENTATION: 'noke' | 'default' = 'default';
// Change to 'noke' when ready
```

**Why**: Easy migration without breaking UI code

---

## Risk Management

### Low Risk Strategy

‚úÖ **Fallback**: Keep library working during migration  
‚úÖ **Incremental**: Test each piece before adding more  
‚úÖ **Validated**: Infrastructure already proven  
‚úÖ **Comparison**: Test native vs library side-by-side  

### If Issues Arise

- Switch back to library implementation
- Fix native code iteratively
- No production impact

---

## What We Need Next

### From Existing Project

1. **iOS BLE Code**
   - Main BLE manager classes
   - Scanning and connection logic
   - Noke protocol implementation
   - Any dependencies

2. **Documentation**
   - How it works
   - Known bugs
   - Noke protocol specs

3. **Testing**
   - Noke devices for testing
   - Expected behaviors
   - Test scenarios

---

## Key Decisions

### Why Custom Native vs Library?

| Requirement | Library | Native |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Basic BLE | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Noke Protocols | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| IoT Features | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Full Control | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Performance | Good | Better |

**Decision**: ‚úÖ Custom Native Required

### Why Now?

- Infrastructure ready and validated
- Clear migration path
- Low risk (library as fallback)
- Noke features need native implementation

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Current) ‚úÖ
- [x] App compiles and runs
- [x] BLE scanning works (library)
- [x] Native modules validated
- [ ] Manager approval to proceed

### Phase 2 (Next)
- [ ] Native scanning matches library
- [ ] Connection management works
- [ ] No regressions

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
- [ ] Noke protocols implemented
- [ ] All IoT features working
- [ ] Production stable

### Phase 4 (Complete)
- [ ] Library removed
- [ ] Native module in production
- [ ] Deployed to users

## Immediate Actions

### This Week
1. ‚úÖ Test current app (all tabs)
2. üìã Review this summary with manager
3. üì¶ Get existing native code access
4. üéØ Approve migration plan

### Next Week
1. Code review session
2. Begin Phase 2 implementation
3. Import scanning logic
4. Initial testing

---

## Recommendation

**Proceed with native module migration**

**Reasons**:
1. Noke IoT features require it (not optional)
2. Infrastructure validated and ready
3. Low risk with library fallback
4. Clear 6-8 week timeline
5. Full control and customization

**ROI**:
- Better performance
- Noke feature support
- Reduced dependency risk
- Faster bug fixes
- Long-term maintainability

---

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ  
**Next**: Get manager approval + access to existing code  
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks to production  
**Risk**: Low (validated infrastructure + fallback option)
