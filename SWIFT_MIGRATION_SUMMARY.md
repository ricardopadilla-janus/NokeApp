# NativeScanner: Objective-C to Swift Migration Summary

## Overview

The **NativeScanner** module has been successfully migrated from Objective-C to Swift, providing a more modern and maintainable implementation while maintaining full compatibility with React Native's architecture.

---

## What Changed

### Before (Objective-C)
```
modules/NativeScanner/ios/
├── NativeScanner.h          # Header file
└── NativeScanner.mm         # Implementation (Objective-C++)
```

### After (Swift)
```
modules/NativeScanner/ios/
├── NativeScanner.swift                  # Swift implementation
├── NativeScannerModule.m                # ObjC bridge for RN
└── NativeScanner-Bridging-Header.h      # Swift-ObjC bridge
```

---

## Key Changes

### 1. Language Migration
- **From**: Objective-C++ (`.h` + `.mm` files)
- **To**: Swift 5+ (`.swift` file)

### 2. Implementation Style

**Objective-C (Before)**:
```objective-c
@interface NativeScanner : RCTEventEmitter <RCTBridgeModule>
@end

@implementation NativeScanner

RCT_EXPORT_MODULE();

RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(startScan:(double)seconds
                  resolve:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                  reject:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject) {
    // Implementation...
}

@end
```

**Swift (After)**:
```swift
@objc(NativeScanner)
class NativeScanner: RCTEventEmitter, CBCentralManagerDelegate {
    
    @objc(startScan:resolve:reject:)
    func startScan(durationSeconds: Double,
                   resolve: @escaping RCTPromiseResolveBlock,
                   reject: @escaping RCTPromiseRejectBlock) {
        // Implementation...
    }
}
```

### 3. Module Registration

**New file added**: `NativeScannerModule.m`
```objective-c
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>
#import <React/RCTEventEmitter.h>

@interface RCT_EXTERN_MODULE(NativeScanner, RCTEventEmitter)

RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(startScan:(double)durationSeconds
                  resolve:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                  reject:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)

RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(stopScan:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                  reject:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)

RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(isScanning:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                  reject:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)

@end
```

### 4. Bridging Header

**New file added**: `NativeScanner-Bridging-Header.h`
```objective-c
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>
#import <React/RCTEventEmitter.h>
```

This allows Swift to access React Native's Objective-C APIs.

## Benefits of Swift Migration

### ✅ Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: Swift's strong type system prevents many runtime errors
- **Null Safety**: Optional types (`?`) make nil handling explicit
- **Modern Syntax**: Cleaner, more readable code
- **Less Boilerplate**: Swift reduces ceremony compared to Objective-C

### ✅ Maintainability
- **Easier to Read**: More intuitive syntax for new developers
- **Better Error Handling**: Swift's `guard` and error handling patterns
- **Modern Patterns**: Closures, generics, protocol extensions

### ✅ Performance
- **Optimized Compiler**: Swift compiler produces efficient code
- **Memory Safety**: ARC with value types where appropriate
- **Dispatch Queues**: Clean async handling with `@escaping` closures

### ✅ iOS Best Practices
- **Recommended by Apple**: Swift is the preferred language for iOS
- **CoreBluetooth Integration**: More natural Swift API usage
- **Future-Proof**: Apple continues investing in Swift

---

## What Stayed the Same

### ✅ Functionality
- All methods work identically: `startScan()`, `stopScan()`, `isScanning()`
- All events emit the same: `DeviceDiscovered`, `ScanStopped`, `BluetoothStateChanged`
- Same device discovery behavior and RSSI updates

### ✅ JavaScript API
- **No changes** to JavaScript/TypeScript code
- Same imports, same method calls, same event listeners
- Fully backward compatible from React Native perspective

### ✅ Architecture Support
- Still supports **both** Old and New Architecture
- Turbo Module codegen works the same
- Event emitter pattern unchanged

### ✅ Performance
- Same CoreBluetooth usage
- Same background dispatch queue
- Same scanning configuration

## Technical Details

### How Swift Works with React Native

1. **Swift Class** (`NativeScanner.swift`)
   - Uses `@objc` attribute to expose to Objective-C runtime
   - Inherits from `RCTEventEmitter` for event emission
   - Implements `CBCentralManagerDelegate` for BLE

2. **Bridge Module** (`NativeScannerModule.m`)
   - Uses `RCT_EXTERN_MODULE` to register Swift class
   - Uses `RCT_EXTERN_METHOD` to export methods to JS
   - Acts as glue between Swift and React Native

3. **Bridging Header** (`NativeScanner-Bridging-Header.h`)
   - Allows Swift to import Objective-C headers
   - Makes React Native APIs available to Swift

4. **Podspec** (`NativeScanner.podspec`)
   - Updated to include Swift files
   - Configured with proper Swift version

### Architecture Compatibility

**New Architecture (Turbo Modules)**:
```
JavaScript (JSI) → Codegen → Swift Class → CoreBluetooth
```

**Old Architecture (Bridge)**:
```
JavaScript (Bridge) → RCT_EXTERN_METHOD → Swift Class → CoreBluetooth
```

Both paths work seamlessly with Swift thanks to `@objc` bridging.

## Code Comparison

### Method Implementation

**Objective-C**:
```objective-c
RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(startScan:(double)seconds
                  resolve:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                  reject:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject) {
    if (self.centralManager.state != CBManagerStatePoweredOn) {
        reject(@"BLE_NOT_READY", @"Bluetooth is not powered on", nil);
        return;
    }
    // More code...
}
```

**Swift**:
```swift
@objc(startScan:resolve:reject:)
func startScan(durationSeconds: Double,
               resolve: @escaping RCTPromiseResolveBlock,
               reject: @escaping RCTPromiseRejectBlock) {
    
    guard centralManager.state == .poweredOn else {
        reject("BLE_NOT_READY", "Bluetooth is not powered on", nil)
        return
    }
    // More code...
}
```

### Delegate Implementation

**Objective-C**:
```objective-c
- (void)centralManager:(CBCentralManager *)central
 didDiscoverPeripheral:(CBPeripheral *)peripheral
     advertisementData:(NSDictionary<NSString *,id> *)advertisementData
                  RSSI:(NSNumber *)RSSI {
    
    NSDictionary *deviceInfo = @{
        @"id": peripheral.identifier.UUIDString,
        @"name": peripheral.name ?: @"Unknown",
        @"rssi": RSSI
    };
    [self sendEventWithName:@"DeviceDiscovered" body:deviceInfo];
}
```

**Swift**:
```swift
func centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager,
                   didDiscover peripheral: CBPeripheral,
                   advertisementData: [String: Any],
                   rssi RSSI: NSNumber) {
    
    let deviceInfo: [String: Any] = [
        "id": peripheral.identifier.uuidString,
        "name": peripheral.name ?? "Unknown",
        "rssi": RSSI
    ]
    sendEvent(withName: "DeviceDiscovered", body: deviceInfo)
}
```

**Advantages**: Swift's optional chaining (`??`) and type inference make the code more concise.

## For Future Developers

### Working with Swift Modules

When modifying NativeScanner:

1. **Edit Swift file**: `modules/NativeScanner/ios/NativeScanner.swift`
2. **If adding methods**: Update `NativeScannerModule.m` with `RCT_EXTERN_METHOD`
3. **If adding events**: Add to `supportedEvents()` array in Swift
4. **If new imports needed**: Add to bridging header
5. **Rebuild**: `cd ios && pod install && cd .. && npm run ios`

### Mixing Languages

You can have multiple modules in different languages:
- TestModule: Objective-C++
- NativeScanner: Swift
- NokeBleManager: Objective-C++ (or migrate to Swift)

React Native doesn't care—the bridge works with both!

### When to Use Swift vs Objective-C

**Use Swift for**:
- ✅ New modules
- ✅ Heavy CoreBluetooth or iOS framework usage
- ✅ Complex delegate patterns
- ✅ Modern iOS features

**Use Objective-C for**:
- ⚠️ Legacy code integration
- ⚠️ Complex C++ interop
- ⚠️ When porting existing ObjC code quickly
