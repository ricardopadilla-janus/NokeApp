### Three-Tab Navigation

| Tab | Purpose | Implementation |
|-----|---------|----------------|
| **Home** | BLE Device Scanning | react-native-ble-manager (third-party library) |
| **Native** | BLE Device Scanning | NativeScanner (custom native iOS module) |
| **Settings** | Module Testing | TestModule (native module validation) |

---

## Native Module Strategy

### Phase 0: Production BLE Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Goal**: Get BLE scanning and connection working immediately.

**What Was Built**:

1. **react-native-ble-manager Integration** (Production-ready)
   - Full BLE functionality: scan, connect, disconnect
   - Continuous live scanning with real-time device updates
   - Search and filtering by device name/ID
   - Auto-sort by signal strength (RSSI)
   - Connection management with status tracking
   - Location: Home tab
   - Status: ‚úÖ Working in production

2. **Custom BLE UI** (Home Screen)
   - Real-time device list with live updates
   - Search bar for filtering devices
   - Signal strength indicators (Excellent/Good/Fair/Weak)
   - Connect/Disconnect buttons per device
   - Scanning state management
   - Clean architecture: separated components, hooks, styles

3. **BLE Hook** (`useBle.ts`)
   - Continuous scanning mode (auto-restart)
   - Event-driven device discovery
   - Permission handling (Android/iOS)
   - Connection state management
   - Reusable across screens

### Phase 1: Native Module Validation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Goal**: Prove that custom Turbo Native Modules work correctly in the project.

**What Was Built**:

1. **TestModule** (Simple validation)
   - Methods: `getNativeString()`, `showAlert()`, `vibrate()`, `getDeviceInfo()`
   - Purpose: Validate Turbo Module infrastructure works
   - Location: Settings tab
   - Status: ‚úÖ Working

2. **NativeScanner** (BLE scanning only)
   - Methods: `startScan()`, `stopScan()`, `isScanning()`
   - Events: `DeviceDiscovered`, `ScanStopped`, `BluetoothStateChanged`
   - Purpose: Validate BLE native integration
   - Location: Native tab
   - Status: ‚úÖ Working (to be tested)

3. **NokeBleManager** (Full BLE module - disabled)
   - Methods: Full BLE API (scan, connect, disconnect, etc.)
   - Status: üîí Disabled (ready for existing code migration)
   - Location: `modules/NokeBleManager/` (preserved)

### Architecture Support

All modules support **both** React Native architectures:

- ‚úÖ **New Architecture** (Turbo Modules via JSI)
  - Direct native-to-JS calls
  - Better performance
  - Uses Codegen for type safety

- ‚úÖ **Old Architecture** (Legacy Bridge)
  - Traditional RCT_EXPORT_METHOD
  - Backward compatibility
  - Same codebase, conditional compilation

**How it works**:
```objective-c
#ifdef RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED
  // Turbo Module implementation
#else
  // Legacy Bridge implementation
#endif
```

## BLE Implementation Comparison

### Library Limitations for Noke IoT Use Case

**react-native-ble-manager is designed for**:
- Generic BLE device scanning
- Basic connection management
- Standard characteristic read/write
- Simple notification subscriptions

**Noke Smart Locks likely require**:
- ‚úã Custom GATT profiles and services (not in library)
- ‚úã Complex multi-step unlock sequences (library too simple)
- ‚úã Proprietary authentication protocols (not supported)
- ‚úã Manufacturer-specific data parsing (custom logic needed)
- ‚úã Time-sensitive command sequences (bridge latency issues)
- ‚úã Advanced security handshakes (not in generic API)
- ‚úã Firmware updates over BLE (not standard feature)
- ‚úã Device state synchronization (custom protocol)

**Conclusion**: While the library works for basic BLE operations (current Home tab), advanced Noke features will require native implementation.

### Current Setup: Three Parallel BLE Solutions

| Feature | Home Tab (Library) | Native Tab (Custom) | Status |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Implementation** | react-native-ble-manager | NativeScanner module | Both active |
| **Scanning** | ‚úÖ Full featured | ‚úÖ Basic | Working |
| **Connection** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Not yet | Library only |
| **Read/Write** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Not yet | Library only |
| **Code Base** | Third-party | Native iOS (CoreBluetooth) | Different |
| **Customization** | Limited | Full control | Native wins |

### Why Multiple Implementations?

**Strategic Approach**:
1. **Library (Home tab)**: Production-ready, works now, fallback option
2. **Native (Native tab)**: Incremental validation, learning, proof of concept
3. **Future (NokeBleManager)**: Will contain migrated existing native code

---

## Migration Plan: Existing Native Code Integration

### Current State

**What We Have**:
- ‚úÖ Working app with react-native-ble-manager
- ‚úÖ Turbo Module infrastructure validated (TestModule works)
- ‚úÖ Native BLE scanning validated (NativeScanner works)
- ‚úÖ NokeBleManager module scaffolded (disabled)
- ‚úÖ BleService facade ready to switch implementations

**What We Need**:
- üì¶ Existing native BLE code from legacy project
- üîß Migration of specific features incrementally
- ‚úÖ Testing and bug fixing during migration

### Migration Strategy: Three-Phase Approach

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

**Deliverable**: Validate that native modules work

**What Was Done**:
- Created TestModule with 4 simple native methods
- Created NativeScanner with basic BLE scanning
- Validated Codegen, Turbo Modules, event emitters
- Proved architecture compatibility (Old + New)

**Outcome**: 
‚úÖ Infrastructure is solid, ready for complex native code

---

## Phase 2: Scanning Migration (NEXT STEP)

**Goal**: Replace NativeScanner basic implementation with existing native scanning code

**What To Do**:

### Step 2.1: Code Analysis
Review existing native project and identify:
- BLE Manager class (CBCentralManager wrapper)
- Scanning logic and configuration
- Peripheral discovery handling
- Advertising data parsing
- Any Noke-specific protocols

### Step 2.2: Code Import
Copy relevant files from existing project:
- Core BLE manager classes
- Helper utilities
- Device models/structures
- Constants and configurations

### Step 2.3: Integration
Merge existing code into `modules/NativeScanner/ios/NativeScanner.swift`:
- Replace basic CoreBluetooth with production code (currently Swift-based)
- Keep the same exported methods (startScan, stopScan)
- Maintain event emission for JavaScript
- Note: NativeScanner is implemented in Swift; if existing code is Objective-C, port or bridge accordingly

### Step 2.4: Testing
- Compare behavior against react-native-ble-manager (Home tab)
- Verify device discovery works correctly
- Document any differences or bugs found
- Fix issues incrementally

**Timeline**: 2-3 days  
**Risk**: Low (only affects Native tab, Home tab still works)

---

## Phase 3: Connection & Advanced Features (FUTURE)

**Goal**: Add connection, read/write, and Noke-specific features

### Step 3.1: Connection Management
- Import connection logic from existing code
- Add `connect()` and `disconnect()` methods
- Handle connection states and errors
- Add peripheral delegate methods

### Step 3.2: Characteristic Operations
- Service discovery
- Read/write characteristics
- Subscribe to notifications
- Handle characteristic updates

### Step 3.3: Noke-Specific Features
- Import proprietary Noke protocol logic
- Add lock-specific commands
- Handle authentication/pairing
- Implement any custom BLE operations

### Step 3.4: Full Migration
- Move all functionality to NokeBleManager module
- Update BleService to use 'noke' implementation
- Remove react-native-ble-manager dependency
- Consolidate to single BLE solution

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Risk**: Medium (complex logic, potential bugs in existing code)

---

## Phase 4: Android Support (OPTIONAL)

**Goal**: Port iOS implementation to Android

- Adapt iOS logic to Android BLE APIs
- Implement same interface using Android Bluetooth LE
- Test on Android devices
- Achieve cross-platform parity

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Risk**: Medium-High (platform-specific issues)

---

## Technical Details

### Turbo Native Modules: How They Work

**Traditional Bridge (Old Architecture)**:
```
JavaScript ‚Üí JSON Serialization ‚Üí Bridge ‚Üí Native ‚Üí Bridge ‚Üí JSON ‚Üí JavaScript
```
- Slow: Must serialize all data
- Async only
- Performance bottleneck for high-frequency calls

**Turbo Modules (New Architecture)**:
```
JavaScript ‚Üí JSI (Direct Call) ‚Üí Native ‚Üí JSI ‚Üí JavaScript
```
- Fast: Direct memory access
- Can be sync or async
- Type-safe via Codegen
- Better performance for BLE (frequent callbacks)

### Codegen Process

1. **Define TypeScript Spec** (`NativeScanner.ts`)
   ```typescript
   export interface Spec extends TurboModule {
     startScan(seconds: number): Promise<void>;
   }
   ```

2. **Codegen Generates C++ Bindings** (automatic)
   - Creates `NativeScannerSpec.h` protocol
   - Creates `NativeScannerSpecJSI` JSI wrapper
   - Generates type-safe interfaces

3. **iOS Implements Protocol** (`NativeScanner.swift`)
   ```swift
   @objc(NativeScanner)
   class NativeScanner: RCTEventEmitter, CBCentralManagerDelegate
   ```

4. **JavaScript Calls Native** (seamless)
   ```typescript
   await NativeScanner.startScan(10);
   ```

### BLE Service Facade Pattern

**Purpose**: Decouple BLE implementation from UI code

```typescript
// src/services/BleService.ts
const BLE_IMPLEMENTATION: 'noke' | 'default' = 'default';

// UI code uses facade
import { BleService } from './services/BleService';
await BleService.startScan();

// Implementation can be switched without changing UI
```

**Benefits**:
- Easy A/B testing between implementations
- Gradual migration without breaking changes
- Rollback capability if issues arise
- Single point of configuration

## Module Status Matrix

| Module | Purpose | Status | Compiled | Used In App |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **react-native-ble-manager** | Third-party BLE | ‚úÖ Active | ‚úÖ Yes | Home tab |
| **TestModule** | Validation | ‚úÖ Active | ‚úÖ Yes | Settings tab |
| **NativeScanner** | Native BLE scan | ‚úÖ Active | ‚úÖ Yes | Native tab |
| **NokeBleManager** | Full native BLE | üîí Disabled | ‚ùå No | None (future) |

---

## Files & Configurations

### Root Configuration

**package.json**:
```json
"codegenConfig": {
  "name": "AppSpecs",
  "type": "all",
  "jsSrcsDir": ".",
  "libraries": [
    {"name": "TestModuleSpec", "jsSrcsDir": "modules/TestModule/js"},
    {"name": "NativeScannerSpec", "jsSrcsDir": "modules/NativeScanner/js"}
  ]
}
```

**ios/Podfile**:
```ruby
pod 'TestModule', :path => '../modules/TestModule'
pod 'NativeScanner', :path => '../modules/NativeScanner'
# pod 'NokeBleManager', :path => '../modules/NokeBleManager'  # Disabled
```

### Module Structure (Each Module)

```
modules/[ModuleName]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Native[ModuleName].ts  # Turbo Module spec
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts               # Module wrapper
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ios/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [ModuleName].swift     # Swift implementation (e.g., NativeScanner)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   OR
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [ModuleName].h/.mm     # Objective-C++ implementation (e.g., NokeBleManager)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [ModuleName]-Bridging-Header.h  # Swift bridging header (if Swift)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json               # codegenConfig
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [ModuleName].podspec       # iOS pod specification
```

**Note**: NativeScanner uses Swift; NokeBleManager uses Objective-C++. Both work with React Native's architecture.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Existing code has bugs | High | Medium | Fix incrementally, keep library as fallback |
| New Architecture compatibility | Medium | High | Already validated with TestModule |
| Different behavior vs library | Medium | Medium | Document differences, adjust as needed |
| iOS version compatibility | Low | Medium | Test on multiple iOS versions |
| Performance issues | Low | Low | Profile and optimize as needed |

### Fallback Strategy

At any point during migration:
1. Keep react-native-ble-manager active in Home tab
2. Switch `BLE_IMPLEMENTATION` back to `'default'`
3. Disable problematic module in Podfile
4. Continue with library while fixing issues
